### Introduction
This repository supports the paper titled "Optimal Activation Functions for the Random Features".

It contains a pdf file with BOTH the main part of the paper and appendices, together, so that the reader can use the links in the pdf to jump from the main paper into to the appendices and vice-versa. 

It also contains code to generate Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 5,

To generate Figure 1 please run RunMeToGenerateFigure1.nb. It requires Wolfram Mathematica v12.	

To generate Figure 4 please run RunMeToGenerateFigure4.m. It requires Matlab 2020b.	

To generate Figure 5 please run RunMeToGenerateFigure5.m. It requires Matlab 2020b.	

Finally, it contains code to symbolically check the formulas in our Theorems 9, 10 and 11.
These are files RunMeToCheckProofOfTheorem9.nb, RunMeToCheckProofOfTheorem10.nb, and RunMeToCheckProofOfTheorem11.nb.
